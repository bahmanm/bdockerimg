ðŸ‘‰ [View on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bdockerimg/quicklisp)

# Variants

There are two main variants of the image for slightely different usecases:

* openSUSE Tumbleweed
* Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS)

# How to use

### âœ“ One-off commands

For example, using the openSUSE Tumbleweed variant:

```
docker run --rm bdockerimg/quicklisp:sbcl-2.4.2--opensuse-tumbleweed --eval '(format t "Hello, world")'

This is SBCL 2.4.2-1.1-suse, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
More information about SBCL is available at <http://www.sbcl.org/>.

Hello, world
```

### âœ“ Lisp projects

Assuming you've saved the overly elborate below snippet at `~/lisp/foo.lisp`:

```lisp
(require :uiop)

(defun greet (name)
  (format t "Hello, ~A" name))

(let ((name (car (uiop:command-line-arguments))))
  (greet name))
```

The following command, uses the image to load and execute the file:

```
docker run --rm --volume ~/tmp/lisp:/project bdockerimg/quicklisp:sbcl-2.1.11--ubuntu-2204 --load foo.lisp world
This is SBCL 2.1.11.debian, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

### âœ“ Scripting

```text
#!/usr/bin/env -S docker run --rm --volume .:/project bdockerimg/quicklisp:sbcl-2.4.2--opensuse-tumbleweed --script

(format t "Hello, world")
```

### âœ“ CI/CD pipeline

Here's a real world example of the image being used in the
[euler-cl](https://github.com/bahmanm/euler-cl) project (CircleCI):
