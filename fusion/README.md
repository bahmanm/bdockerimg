# Fusion 

Docker image fusions streamline development by combining the tools and libraries from multiple base
images into ready-to-use composite images.

# Background and Prelude

Through my work, I've gained a deep understanding of the challenges involved in managing Docker
images effectively. A recurring pain point has been the need to either craft complex,
multi-dependency images manually or repeatedly install the same tools and libraries in different
projects. This inefficiency can be particularly frustrating within CI/CD pipelines, where speed and
automation are essential.

These experiences inspired the concept of "fusions" within bdockerimg. Fusions offer a streamlined
solution by enabling the creation of composite Docker images that combine the strengths of multiple
base images. This approach allows developers to easily access the tools and libraries they need
without repetitive setups, leading to improved workflows and greater consistency across their
development and deployment environments.

# What Are Fusions?

Fusions provide a streamlined way to create composite Docker images that combine the functionalities
of multiple base images. This solves a common pain point in Docker usage: the need to either
manually assemble complex images with various tools and libraries or repetitively install
dependencies within CI/CD pipelines.

Let's break down how fusions work:

1️⃣ Base images: Imagine base Docker images as individual building blocks, each containing a specific
  tool or library (like SDKMAN or QuickLisp).
  
2️⃣ Fusion process: The fusion process merges these base images into a single, unified Docker
  image. This combined image inherits all the tools and libraries from its constituent base images.
  
3️⃣ Resultant image: The outcome is a ready-to-use image that eliminates the need for repeated
  installation of dependencies, saving time and effort.

# Benefits of Fusions

✔️ Efficiency: Fusions replace repetitive installation processes with a single, pre-built image. This
  optimizes workflows, especially in CI/CD pipelines where speed and automation are crucial.
  
✔️ Convenience: Developers can focus on their core tasks instead of spending time on image
  configuration and dependency management.
  
✔️ Reproducibility: Fusion images guarantee a consistent development and deployment environment,
  ensuring builds work as expected across different systems.
